It requires curl so it likely won't work on Windows unless curl is installed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Create channel and a Slack bot: https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot (add the bot to the channel)\r\n2. Download the plugin to Plugins/SlackChat\r\n3. Add configuration in Cuberite root directory: SlackChat.ini\r\n\r\n```\r\n[SlackChat]\r\napiToken=(insert your api token from step #1)\r\nchannel=#minecraft\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to make improvements/suggestions!\r\n",
